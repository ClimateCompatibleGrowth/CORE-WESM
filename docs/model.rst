    note::
    This is the main page of your project's `Sphinx`_ documentation.
    It is formatted in `reStructuredText`_. Add additional pages
    by creating rst-files in ``docs`` and adding them to the `toctree`_ below.
    Use then `references`_ in order to link them from this page, e.g.
    :ref:`authors` and :ref:`changes`.
    It is also possible to refer to the documentation of other Python packages
    with the `Python domain syntax`_. By default you can reference the
    documentation of `Sphinx`_, `Python`_, `NumPy`_, `SciPy`_, `matplotlib`_,
    `Pandas`_, `Scikit-Learn`_. You can add more by extending the
    ``intersphinx_mapping`` in your Sphinx's ``conf.py``.
    The pretty useful extension `autodoc`_ is activated by default and lets
    you include documentation from docstrings. Docstrings can be written in
    `Google style`_ (recommended!), `NumPy style`_ and `classical style`_.
